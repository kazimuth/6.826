> Suppose you are building a network using NetCore, with several servers dedicated to monitoring traffic (in the same sense as the paper's example of logging HTTP traffic). Different traffic (e.g., based on destination address or destination port) gets logged to different servers. How would you formally prove that, on the real network as implemented by OpenFlow switches, all traffic is getting logged to some server? What theorem statements would you need to state in Coq, and what parts of NetCore's formal framework would help you in your proof? 

You'd need to show that, given your NetCore rules, the formal semantics show that the traffic is logged to the correct server. You'd then need to show that the runtime system executes those formal semantics correctly. That part's already been proven, assuming you use their implementation.
