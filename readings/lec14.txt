> The CSPEC paper argues that Release for a lock can be thought of as a left-mover because the Release can be moved left in an execution trace. But moving a Release left would seemingly affect what is legal afterwards: namely, if Release is moved left, then another thread can now Acquire the lock sooner than it would have otherwise been able to. What does it mean for Release to be a left-mover then? 

The mover formal definition of a left-mover doesn't consider newly-legal operations after a commute. it simply states that, for any execution trace where a Release appears after some other operation, that Release can legally be moved before it. So, yes the thread *could* acquire the lock sooner, but (for any particular trace) we don't consider that case.

(since we (formally) consider all possible interleavings anyway, that release might show up in some other trace, though?)
