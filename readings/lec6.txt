2 but not 1: a nondeterministic spec that is compiled to a deterministic code. 3 but not 2: a spec that exhibits "wrong" behavior in some cases, but compiles correctly without those cases.

RE: desired properties, i mean, it depends on what you include in B. CompCert doesn't include some information leakage channels + timing information in there; but if you added those, it seems like it would be pretty bulletproof.
